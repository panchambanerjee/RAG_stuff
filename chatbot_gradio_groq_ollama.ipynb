Introduction and Overview\\n1.1 Introduction\\nThe Milky Way, the galaxy in which we live, is but one\\nof many galaxies. As a matter of fact, the Milky Way,\\nalso called the Galaxy, is a fairly average representative\\nof the class of spiral galaxies. Two other examples of\\nspiral galaxies are shown in Fig. 1.1 and Fig. 1.2, one of\\nwhich we are viewing from above (face-on), the other\\nfrom the side (edge-on). These are all stellar systems in\\nwhich the majority of stars are conﬁned to a relatively\\nthin disk. In our own Galaxy, this disk can be seen as\\nthe band of stars stretched across the night sky, which\\nled to it being named the Milky Way. Besides such\\ndisk galaxies, there is a second major class of luminous\\nstellar systems, the elliptical galaxies.
